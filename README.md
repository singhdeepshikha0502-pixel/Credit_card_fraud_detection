# Credit_card_fraud_detection
# 🧾 Credit Card Fraud & Risk Monitoring Dashboard

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Banks process millions of credit card transactions every day — while only a tiny percentage are fraudulent, they result in significant financial loss and broken customer trust.

Fraud analysts need:
- A **fast way to flag high-risk transactions**
- A **risk score instead of binary labeling**
- Clear **KPIs and dashboard insights** to detect patterns

This project builds an **end-to-end fraud monitoring pipeline** using Python, SQL, Machine Learning, and Power BI.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

**Goal:**  
Assign each transaction a fraud **risk score (0–1)**, bucket it into **High / Medium / Low**, and monitor patterns in an interactive dashboard.

**What was built:**
- ✔️ Full end-to-end dataset cleaning (~1.3M rows)
- ✔️ SQL feature store using **SQLite + SQLAlchemy**
- ✔️ ML model to calculate fraud probability
- ✔️ Categorization into risk buckets
- ✔️ Power BI dashboard for monitoring fraud behavior

---

## 📂 Dataset Details

- **Source:** Synthetic credit card transaction dataset
- **Total Rows Used:** ~1,296,675  
- **Target Variable:** `is_fraud` (0 = genuine, 1 = fraud)

**Key Features:**
- Transaction: `amt`, `unix_time`
- Customer: `gender`, `age`, `state`, `city_pop`
- Merchant: `merchant`, `category`, `merch_lat`, `merch_long`
- Engineered:
  - `amt_log` → log transformed amount  
  - `distance_km` → Haversine distance  
  - `time_of_day` → Morning / Afternoon / Evening / Night  
  - `risk_score`, `risk_bucket`

> For GitHub size constraints, I included **only a sample dataset**:  
> `fraud_sample.csv`

## 🚧 Modeling Workflow

### **1️⃣ Data Preparation**
- Loaded raw data in **chunks** due to file size
- Cleaned and transformed into parquet format
- Created a reusable SQL feature table

---

### **2️⃣ Feature Engineering**

Implemented in: `CreditCardFraud_EDA_and_Model.ipynb`

- Log transformation on skewed values (`amt_log`)
- Haversine distance calculation (`distance_km`)
- Time segmentation (`time_of_day`)
- Encoding strategy:
  - Frequency encoding → `merchant`, `category`
  - Label encoding → `gender`, `state`, `time_of_day`
- Stratified train-test split on `is_fraud`

---

### **3️⃣ Machine Learning Model**

Used a simple but explainable model:


model = LogisticRegression(
    class_weight="balanced",
    max_iter=300,
    n_jobs=-1
)
---
#### 🔍 Model Choice: Logistic Regression

Logistic Regression was selected because:

✔️ Works well for imbalanced tabular datasets

✔️ Produces interpretable probability scores

✔️ Fast to train on large datasets (~1.3M rows)

✔️ Commonly used in real-world fraud scoring systems

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

🖼 Preview: `fraud_risk_dashboard.png`

This dashboard uses the model outputs (`risk_score`, `risk_bucket`) to monitor fraud behavior at scale.

---

### ⭐ **Key Metrics Displayed**

- **Total Transactions**
- **Total Fraud Transactions**
- **Fraud Rate (%)**
- **High-Risk Transaction Count**
- **High-Risk Fraud Rate (%)**

---

### 📌 **Dashboard Visuals**

| Visual Type | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| 📈 Fraud Trend Over Time | Identify spikes and fraud patterns |
| 🥧 Risk Bucket Distribution | Compare High vs Medium vs Low risk |
| 🏬 Top High-Risk Merchants | Detect merchants repeatedly linked to fraud |
| 🛒 Top High-Risk Categories | Understand risky purchase categories |
| 🗺 Fraud by State (Map) | Identify geographic fraud hotspots |
| 👩‍🦰 Fraud Rate by Gender | Understand demographic patterns |
| 📏 Fraud vs Distance | Compare fraud likelihood with transaction distance |

---

### 🧠 **Insights Summary**

- 🔺 The **High-risk bucket** contains the majority of confirmed fraud.
- 📍 Fraud increases when:
  - The **customer–merchant distance is high**
  - The transaction occurs during **specific time windows**
- 🏷 A small number of **merchants & categories repeatedly appear** in fraud — indicating repeat fraud patterns.
